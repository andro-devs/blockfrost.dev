## Add a new Secure Webhook

To create a new Secure Webhook go to [Blockfrost Dashboard](https://blockfrost.io/dashboard) and click on **Add webhook** button. In the webhook settings, fill in the webhook name, select the trigger event your app needs, and create the necessary [Trigger conditions](./webhooks-conditions). Do not worry about not getting everything right, you can update the settings anytime.

The webhook endpoint URL should be set to a publicly accessible HTTPS URL, where you will process the events sent via webhook request. If you do not have your backend exposed to the web, follow the steps in [Test your webhook](using-webhooks#test-your-webhook) to test with a web server running on your local machine.

### Rollbacks and a required number of confirmations

Events are sent to your webhook endpoint after reaching the number of confirmations you specified in Secure Webhook Settings.
It may happen that the Cardano network rollbacks a few blocks, invalidating events that have been sent. Due to rollbacks, you may receive the same event multiple times.

:::note Example
Let's say you set up a Secure Webhook for a transaction event with the number of required confirmations set to 0. The transaction you are interested in gets included in a block so you will be notified about the transaction. Then the block is rolled back and the same transaction is included in a new block. You will receive another transaction event with the same transaction hash, but the hash of the block in which the transaction was included will differ from the first event).
:::

We recommend verifying that the event you received has not been rolled back or increasing the number of required confirmations before the event is sent to your endpoint.

## Process a webhook request

Create an HTTP endpoint on your backend where you will process incoming events and trigger actions you want to execute.
The endpoint must accept `POST` requests with data in JSON format and return a successful status code (`2xx`).

Each request body is an object with several fields. The event type is stored in `type` field. The event itself is included in `payload` field. For the complete structure of a webhook request, see [Events overview](./webhooks-events).

Don't forget to verify that the event originated from Blockfrost, not a third party just pretending to be Blockfrost. See [Check signatures](./webhooks-signatures).

Here is a quick example of a web application that implements `/webhook` endpoint and leverages the Blockfrost SDK to verify the webhook signature:

### Retries

In case your webhook endpoint is responding with one of following error status codes: `400`, `408`, `413`, `429`, `500`, `502`, `503`, `504`, `521`, `522` or `524`, Blockfrost will resend the request 2 more times with few seconds of backoff between each request. Body of the request is the same between retries, the ID of the retried request will be the same as the ID of the original request that failed.

:::tip
To help you with troubleshooting problems with your endpoint, check the list of recent failed requests in Secure Webhook settings in [Blockfrost Dashboard](https://blockfrost.io/dashboard).
:::

If your webhook endpoint doesn't respond with a successful status code (`2xx`) within few seconds then the request will time out.

:::caution
To prevent unexpected issues, your application should be prepared for a scenario in which the webhook request never arrives.
To keep your app fully functioning and still provide a good user experience, you can manually fetch the data via the traditional [Blockfrost API](https://docs.blockfrost.io).
:::

## Test your webhook

### Webhook.site

The easiest way to explore the data sent via a webhook is to point it to a service such as [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site).
It generates a random URL and displays every request sent to this address and its body.

### Local web server

In order to test Secure Webhooks with your endpoint implementation running on your local HTTP dev server, you need to expose it to the web. Fortunately, services like [Loophole.cloud](https://loophole.cloud/) will set it up for you.

Follow [Loophole documentation](https://loophole.cloud/docs) to download the CLI or the Desktop GUI app, create an account and expose your local HTTP server.

:::note Example
To expose a local web server running on port 6666 via CLI, run the command `loophole http 6666`.
In the Webhook settings, set the webhook endpoint to the URL you will see in the output (if you are using [the example](using-webhooks#process-a-webhook-request) do not forget to append `/webhook` at the end).

```

$ loophole http 6666
Loophole - End to end TLS encrypted TCP communication between you and your clients
Registering your domain... Success!
Starting local proxy server... Success!
Initializing secure tunnel... Success!

Forwarding https://1a4ab363d5cfd01cccc9fba73777770c.loophole.site -> http://127.0.0.1:6666

```
